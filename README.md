Installation
------------

Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder
/blocks/login_userinfo

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Placement
---------

block_login_userinfo is used ideally as sticky block and appears on all of your moodle pages at the same position

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Block_settings#Making_a_block_sticky_throughout_the_whole_site for details about sticky blocks


Usage
-----

The block_login_userinfo plugin has two views:

* As long as the user is logged out, it displays a login form just as block_login does.
* As soon as the user is logged in, block_login dispears. In contrast to this, block_login_userinfo displays pleasant information about the logged in user like his/her username, his/her avatar. Additionally, it displays a logout button where the user expects it to be: exactly at the position where the login button was previously.

Furthermore, for teachers and admins, block_login_userinfo shows exactly the same information as the login info section which is normally found in the top right corner of your moodle page - especially information about role changes and about failed user logins.


Themes
------

block_login_userinfo should work with all Bootstrap based Moodle themes.

As block_login_userinfo duplicates information and widgets from the login info section which is normally found in the top right corner of your moodle page, I recommend to experienced themers to remove $OUTPUT->login_info() from your theme layout files.


Settings
--------

block_login_userinfo has neither a settings page nor settings in config.php.


Further information
-------------------

block_login_userinfo is found in the Moodle Plugins repository: https://moodle.org/plugins/view/block_login_userinfo

Moodle release support
----------------------

Due to limited resources, block_login_userinfo is only maintained for the most recent major release of Moodle. However, previous versions of this plugin which work in legacy major releases of Moodle are still available as-is without any further updates in the Moodle Plugins repository.

There may be several weeks after a new major release of Moodle has been published until we can do a compatibility check and fix problems if necessary. If you encounter problems with a new major release of Moodle - or can confirm that block_login_userinfo still works with a new major relase - please let us know on https://github.com/moodleuulm/moodle-block_login_userinfo/issues


Right-to-left support
---------------------

This plugin has not been tested with Moodle's support for right-to-left (RTL) languages.
If you want to use this plugin with a RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, you are free to send me a pull request on
github with modifications.
